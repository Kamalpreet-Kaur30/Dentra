ðŸ¦· **Dentra** â€” Your Smart Dental AI Assistant
Dentra is a modern dental care web application that helps users connect with an AI-powered voice assistant for their dental queries and book appointments seamlessly.
Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Neon DB (PostgreSQL)
Prisma, it offers a smooth and interactive experience for users to explore dental guidance anytime.

Users can talk to the AI Dental Assistant (powered by VAPI) through voice and get instant responses related to their dental concerns. They can also log in securely using Clerk, manage their profiles, and book or view upcoming appointments.

The app includes an Admin Panel where doctors can be added or updated (currently with sample data for demo purposes). Payments and authentication are handled through Clerk, making the process simple and secure.
